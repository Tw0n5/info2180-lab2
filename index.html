                <h2> Toyota Starlet </h2>

                <article class="post"> The Toyota Starlet is a subcompact car that was produced by Toyota from 1973 to 1999, 
                    and later reintroduced in 2020 for select markets. Initially designed as a small, practical vehicle, 
                    the early Starlet models were well-regarded for their simplicity, reliability, and affordability, making them popular 
                    among budget-conscious drivers. Over its first production run, the Starlet went through multiple generations, transitioning from rear-wheel 
                    drive in the early models to front-wheel drive by the 1980s. The car was available in various body styles, including hatchback, sedan, and station wagon, 
                    and became well-known for its fuel efficiency and easy-to-maintain nature.

                    After a hiatus, Toyota brought back the Starlet name in 2020 as a rebadged version of the Suzuki Baleno for markets like South Africa and parts of Asia. 
                    The modern Starlet continues to uphold its reputation for practicality, offering compact dimensions ideal for urban driving, modern technology, and improved 
                    safety features. Though the newer model doesn't boast the same sporty appeal of some earlier variants like the Starlet GT Turbo, it remains an accessible and dependable 
                    option for drivers seeking a budget-friendly and versatile vehicle.
